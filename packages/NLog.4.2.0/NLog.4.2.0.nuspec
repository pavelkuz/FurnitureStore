    <releaseNotes>##Features
- Performance Counter Target: it's now possible to configure the step size for the counter target. Before the step size was always one.
- Mail Target: `pickupDirectoryLocation` and `deliveryMethod` are configurable from the NLog config.
- Cached Layout Renderer: a `clearCache` option has been added for more control over clearing the cache.
- File target: auto add `.zip` to compressed archive  when `archiveName` isn't specified. 

##Bug fixes
- Inner layout can now contain colons
- Colored Console Target: highlight whole words was broken.
- Mail Target: when `useSystemNetMailSettings` was `false`, some settings were still used from the `&lt;mailSettings&gt;` of the .Net config.
- Removed unnecessary System.Drawing references for Xamarin.
- File Target: sometimes an exception was thrown when archiving was enabled.
- File Target: file archiving DateAndSequence &amp; FileArchivePeriod.Day won't always work.
- GetTargetsByLevelForLogger could throw a "Collection was modified" exception.
